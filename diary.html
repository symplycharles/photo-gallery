        HERE YOU WOULD FIND MY WRITE UP's

     <h3>Be Calm</h3>
    <P>
        Be Calm, Your Time Will Come !
Kenya is 2 hrs ahead of Nigeria, but it does not
mean that Nigeria is slow, or that Kenya is fast.
Both countries are working based on their own
"Time Zone."
Some one is still single. Someone got married
and 'waited' 10 yrs before having a child, there is
another who had a baby within a year of
marriage.
Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited
5 years before securing a good job; and there is
another who graduated at 27 and secured
employment immediately !
Someone became CEO at 25 and died at 50
while another became a CEO at 50 and lived to
90 years.
Everyone works based on their 'Time Zone',
People can have things worked out only
according to their pace.
Work in your “time zone”.
Your Colleagues, friends, younger ones might
"seem" to go ahead of you.
Maybe some might "seem" behind you.
Don't envy them or mock them, it's their 'Time
Zone.'
You are in yours!
Hold on, be strong, and stay true to yourself. All
things shall work together for your good.
You’re not late …
You are not early ... 
you’re very much On time!
*RESPECT YOUR TIME ZONE*```
    </P>
