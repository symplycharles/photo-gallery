    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Charles Maduabuchi, I’m a graduate of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I work full time online for a living and I am generally passionate about the internet and how it works. I started my career online in Oct, 2015 and ever since then, I’ve never for once looked back despite all the challenges I encountered as a young entrepreneur.

       I am a young articulate and vibrant individual whose thirst for excellence is second to none. Versatility is my strong point as I try to capitalize on any given opportunity presented to me towards the growth of any working environment I find myself in.                                                          I am spontaneous in every aspect and I tend to portray uprightness and high level of integrity in all that I involve myself in.
       I love to share useful information with people around me and that is what motivated my blogging career.
       Working online has been so fun for me and I enjoy every bit of it. The Secret of achieving success in any area, business or niche is to put God first in everything that you do, have the Zeal to really work hard, start with the right attitude and mindset. Then finally, like and enjoy what you do.
       That is the main driving force behind my success. Thanks
       </p>
